So to run the project:

install the dependancies:

> npm install

in the main src folder and also the server folder. Run the server with 

> node server/index.js

and then 

> npm start

to get the game running at localhost:3000. 

You should then be able to login in through auth0 and play with other online players through the leaderboard.
